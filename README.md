Project Title:
US COVID-19 Cases Analysis (Janâ€“Mar 2023)

Project Overview:
This project analyzes COVID-19 case trends in the United States for the first three months of 2023.
Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer several research questions related to the
evolution of cases, deaths, and mortality rates across states and counties.

The analysis focuses on:
Monthly trends in COVID-19 cases
States and counties most affected
Correlation between cases and deaths
Daily vs cumulative cases
Mortality rates by state
Peak case days and spikes

Key Research Questions & Findings:
1.How did COVID-19 cases change month by month across the US?
Finding: Cases decreased as the months progressed.
January had the highest cases, and by March, the case numbers were significantly lower.
Insight: The downward trend suggests a reduction in transmission during early 2023.

2.Which states had the highest number of cases?
Finding: California, Texas, Florida, and New York had the highest total cases.
Relationship between total cases and deaths by state
Finding: There is a strong positive correlation (0.975) between total cases and total deaths.
Insight: States with more cases also experienced more deaths, indicating the expected proportional impact of COVID-19 spread.

3.How do new daily cases compare to cumulative totals over time?
Finding: The cumulative cases increased steadily, while daily new cases remained relatively constant without major spikes.

4.Which counties had the most cases?
Finding: Los Angeles County reported the highest number of cases among all US counties.

5.Monthly trends of cases per county
Finding: Heatmaps show that some counties consistently had higher cases, while others reported lower numbers.

6.Average mortality rate by state
Finding: Pennsylvania had the highest mortality rate, while Northern Mariana Islands had the lowest.

7.How did the number of cases evolve month by month in each state?
Finding: States like California, Texas, and Florida showed the highest growth from January to March 2023.

8.When did the highest daily or monthly spikes occur?
Finding: Peak daily cases were clearly identifiable and highlighted using scatter plots, showing specific dates of maximum reported cases.

Conclusion:
This analysis demonstrates that:
COVID-19 cases in the US showed a downward trend from January to March 2023.
Certain states and counties bore the brunt of the pandemic, reflecting regional differences in spread and population density.
There is a strong positive correlation between cases and deaths at the state level.
Mortality rates varied significantly by state, indicating potential differences in healthcare capacity and reporting.

Visualizations like line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps helped identify trends, peaks, and hotspots effectively.

This project highlights proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and deriving actionable insights from real-world datasets.
